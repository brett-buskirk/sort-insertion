# Insertion Sorting Algorithm #

This is a visual demonstration of how a insertion sorting algorithm works, using JavaScript and jQuery. I created this project while learning how to code at [The Last Mile](https://thelastmile.org/) in 2019.

To check out this demonstration, simply open the `index.html` file in a browser window and watch the animation. Reload the browser window to watch the animation again with a different set of random values.
